Rainmeter Package for Sublime Text 2

## Installation

### using git:
Create a directory "Rainmeter" in your Sublime Text 2 Package folder ("C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages" on Windows). Then clone the package there using git: git clone https://github.com/merlinthered/sublime-rainmeter.git

### download sublime-package:
Download the.sublime-package file from the [Downloads page](https://github.com/merlinthered/sublime-rainmeter/downloads) and place it in your "Installed Packages" directory ("C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Installed Packages")

I'm looking into adding the package to [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), so installing and keeping up-to-date will be easier

## After Installing

If your Rainmeter is not installed in "C:\Program Files\Rainmeter", copy the file "Rainmeter.sublime-build" into your User directory ("C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User") and edit it, replacing the path to Rainmeter with your own install location.
