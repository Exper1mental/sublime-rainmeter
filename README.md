Rainmeter Package for Sublime Text 2

## Installation

### using git:
Create a directory "Rainmeter" in your Sublime Text 2 Package folder (`C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages` on Windows). Then clone the package there using git: 

		git clone https://github.com/merlinthered/sublime-rainmeter.git

### download sublime-package:
Download the.sublime-package file from the [Downloads page][1] and place it in your "Installed Packages" directory (`C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Installed Packages`)

I'm looking into adding the package to [Package Control][2], so installing and keeping up-to-date will be easier

## After Installing

If your Rainmeter is not installed in `C:\Program Files\Rainmeter`, copy the file `Rainmeter.sublime-build` into your User directory (`C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User`) and edit it, replacing the path to Rainmeter with your own install location.
